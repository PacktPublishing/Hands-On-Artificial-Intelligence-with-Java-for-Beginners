**Build intelligent apps using machine learning and deep learning with Deeplearning4j**

## What is this book about?
Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly in demand as well as relevant in the modern world, where everything is driven by technology and data. AI can be used for automating systems or processes to carry out complex tasks and functions in order to achieve optimal performance and productivity.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Leverage different Java packages and tools such as Weka, RapidMiner, and Deeplearning4j, among others
* Build machine learning models using supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques
* Implement different deep learning algorithms in Deeplearning4j and build applications based on them
* Study the basics of heuristic searching and genetic programming
* Differentiate between syntactic and semantic similarity among texts
